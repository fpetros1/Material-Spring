## Status of this repo
Mailspring failed to communicate releases, progress or just a "one or two months vacation, see ya till then". This means I will not update this repo any more.

## This theme

This theme tries to follow the basic Google Material Design guidelines in Version 2 (lite).

## How to install

1. Download this theme here: [DOWNLOAD ZIP](https://codeload.github.com/LightSnowDev/Material-Spring/zip/master)
2. Unzip/extract the folder somewhere
3. Options -> Install Theme
4. Select the unzipped folder
5. A success message should appear.
6. (You can delete the unzipped folder now)

## Plattform support

This theme was originally made for Windows 10 at a scaling of 125%. I'm not sure how it behaves with Mac or Linux at different resolutions.
